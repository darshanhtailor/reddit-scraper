"Really love this peanut butter, 100% pure natural unsweetened, ideal for pre workout meal, very tasty 😋"
Pure 100% peanut.FYI: Refrigerate after opening to increase shelf life and to stop the oil seperation
"The best about this peanut butter is no added sugar, salt or preservatives.It's completely natural and has no unhealthy ingredients such as palm oil.Good thing."
"Consuming pintola peanut butter from last 5,6 years.. very reasonable price with 100 percent peanuts no harmful substance mix in it, like any stabilizer, sugar etc ."
"The best thing to eat after a workout. Can make a shake or eat it with brown bread with milk, adds the flavour and protein."
"I ordered butter after seeing good reviews on Amazon and is good. It is crunchy. What I like is the fact that it is healthy unlike US peanut butter which could have gmo related challenges. In the end, be aware of calorie consumption with every scoop"
This is my 2nd pack of Pintola peanut butter and i can say it is the best unsweetened peanut butter in terms of taste and freshness. Easy to spread with such a creamy texture with crunchy peanuts in it.
"I have been buying this for quite some time now, tried other brands as well , but this is the best . Best part , no sugar in it"
I really like it's taste and the fact that it doesn't contain any added sugar and hydrogenated oil and preservatives.Go for it without any doubt.
"I've been using Pintola for several years now and its a staple part of our diet. Easy to spread, yummy to eat and amazing health related benefits, its got it all! Would highly recommend to everyone without any hesitation."
"Its completely natural and made of peanuts only, im buying it since 2 to 3 years i guess"
This is a quality product from Pintola. Tastes good and a must buy item if you are looking for a best quality peanut butter.
i used it from 2 years. Awesome product
Been a loyal customer of pintola for atleast 2 years now and every time I'm satisfied with the quality of the product. Never felt like the taste has changed or there's something wrong. Very nice product.
"I have been using the peanut butter for smoothies and and toast and apple slices. And it is a good source of protein, as qell as my family loves it."
This product has original peanut butter taste unlike other brands and I really love it.
Most of the peanut butters turn into an almost solid mass by the time one reaches the end of jar. Pintola maintains the consistency till last spoon. One doesn't have to have a forced peanut shake in order to consume the last bits!
Very nice nd tasty 😌😋
100% natural and tasty .Far better than other peanut butter brands
I bought this peanut butter after a friend recommended it to me. Good one with all natural ingredients and no added oils.
The quality and taste of Pintola peanut butter is authentic.
Really loved the taste of it and it's crunchy texture.
Taste and density of peanut butter is just awesome.
Nutty Goodness with HeartPintola's peanut butter is a delightful blend of rich flavor and creamy texture. A snack with heart!
First of all its 100% peanut butter. And it tastes really good. Highly recommended as a health product.
Nice product with healthy ingredients and good tast
Absolutely crunchy and very good taste must purchase. Best peanut butter product
"I really liked this peanut butter it’s super convenient and easy to incorporate into your diet , scrumptious and full of protein"
This specific peanut butter contains 100% peanuts which is a very good thing. Many other products are available but they do not contain 100% peanuts and that's why this is more preferable over them.
Nice taste and good source of protein
"Best product, best quality, Quick delivery. Overall best product."
Good product
I have been using it from last 2 years and it is safe to say that it is the best peanut butter in the market
Nice product
I have been using this for few months and it is the best in the market
No added sugas best protien source😊
It is best peanut butter. The taste is very authentic and the texture is smooth and creamy .I highly recommend trying this healthy Pintola Peanut Butter
100% peanut butter no BS
Excellent quality and taste. Goes well with my rolled oats cooked in milk.
It's a very good and geniune product.its alsoVery healthy and they have used 100% peanuts to make this product. I have been using this for an year now all I can I am enjoying having it.
Nice product.  I use this product from long time. I recommend this product. Great product by pintola.
This is great for eating with toasts and it's tastes quite well.
Nice product
"The flavour is good. It is however in a fluid state and not easy to spread, unlike other varieties that are more viscous."
Taste is different from other products.
Best to use in balanced diet
Normal person wont be able to eat sugar free peanut butter
No preservatives and sugar
Natural taste and comes with no added sugar
Was needed as a dietary supplement. The product quality is excellent and I recommend it to anyone looking to buy peanut butter
"Not unwanted ingredients, taste good. Healthy !"
Good
I love the packing and overall it's must buy product
I like this but it is too runny. Don't know if it is because it is 100% peanuts.
Good
Good product. I really like the pintola peanut butter.
Good product
No artificial flavors only peanuts nothing else
Taste is good. Good quality peanut.
Good consistency
There is no sugar at all. That's why it is not so tasty.But very healthy product.
"peanut butter was really delicious . I had ordered unsweetened one , consistency was better than any other brand"
"If i ask u that what u eat to gain weight faster and healthier??? I think u got your answerLet me tell u about this in few points...1.

Ingredients ? - 100% peanut butter4 value for money ? - ye to aap decide kro thoda or search krke"
Not added any chemicals. Natural 100%
Good
It's really good product. I liked it so much.
I used it 4-5 times previously during 2yrs...good product to start ur morning meal with bread or milkshake..i like it cause it has good taste with no added sugar & oil (i guess). All time u can get it around ₹150 & on sell time I got it for ₹140.. yes it's slightly pricer side compared to its direct competitors..  Review for the company -1. I think it's price should be around 130-1352. Previously it's consistency was more thick & that was really good.. company should improve its consistency.
"Before this one I finished 350g one, and it was magnificent. I don't know about others but I personally like Creamy than crunchy. But yeah when it comes to peanut butter go for Pintola.Or go to the nearby vendor and get 2kg of Peanuts and grind them to prepare your own butter at home(more convenient;))Edit: It's been a while I've been addicted to peanut butter but it's not an absolute addiction I know my daily consumption has to be nominal, so it is. Nevertheless, the point is ""GO FOR PINTOLA"".kudos to the company for bringing us such an elegant product."
Regular price 400 rs. Rehta hai...But this time I buy this in 377 and for that price it's awesome...Best peanut butter with good protein..
Nice
"We are brand loyal and automatically pick this product. But this time there were inconsistencies is the flavour. It has a strong bitter taste and makes it unpleasant. I still eat it and so does my husband, but my 5 year old who usually likes it, can't deal with it. I get it that it's all natural but please be consistent with quality."
Crunchy and tasty. Go for it.
I liked it
Something is wrong with the Nutrition facts. It says it has 16g protein in one serve of 32g but in 100g it has 30g of protein. A simple quick math can tell you what is wrong with this. 16*3=48g protein for 3 serves that is 96g (<100). I can't say which column of nutrition facts is true. Hopefully they fix this.
"See the product seems good as I’ve been using pintola peanut butter from around past  1-2 years. The product is perfect as compared to other peanut butter. I usually order 1kg pack but this time I decided to go for 2.5kg one. The delivery was quick as I got it one day before. My only concern is that even tho the seal was slightly cut and is visible that it is not used or opened before, but what bothers me is the inner seal who’s was open already. Now I’m not sure that it happened because of the vacuum or what but it was open as you can see in the pictures. Other than that, it’s fine and somehow it has 2.6kg instead of 2.5kg. I don’t know, that inner seal open is kind of major turn off during these pandemic time but maybe it is just because of the vacuum thing."
The oil leaking problem still exists may be the company can work on a better sealing design.
Best
Delicious taste and healthy.
It tastes good and value for money use it within 2 months as its starts secrating oil . and its not bad its a  sign of a organic product
Good
Good product. But the problem is it has too much volume but too less content.It hasn't even been 15 days and it already finished. I only use one spoonfull everyday for oatmeal. It would make much more sense to me to buy peanuts at less than half the price of this peanut butter and grind it myself. Anyway good taste and smell though
"Pros-Cruncy,High protein 10g in 32gm (generally you'll see 6-8gm)No added salt,sugar,gluten, preservatives, Nothing.Vegan and completely healthyCons-Low viscosity,Tastless/Bad taste(bcoz i have tried My protein chocolate,sundrop ,etc)I have gone for it because I add it with my oats protein shake.I cannot use it with bread,roti,or simply scoop out 1 randomly because it tastes bad or has no taste.As I love to do above mentioned I might no go for it again ."
delivery was so fast that I would purchase my grocery from fresh always
I don’t like. The taste is ok but not better vis-a-vis kishan’s or other
"I am a peanut butter fan & like non-suggary stuff. I do not refrigerate the 1 kg pack & it is fresh  even after 1.5 months but make sure the lid it tightly shut.. I add it to almost everything oats , milk shakes, on french toast its yummy. Make sure you stir it before every use. Those who want it sweet, can add a dash of honey."
"Tastes good, easy to spread . Overall one of the best peanut butter"
• The taste is good• Fresh 100%• Taste ok ok• Everything is good but the plastic of the container is bad if we drop it will get damaged
"I received package without any damages or leakage, unlike some other buyers. I have been having peanut butter overseas regularly and this was my first purchase in India. I always bought peanut butter without additives and sometimes freshly prepared in front of me. What I found different about this one is the consistency. It is too watery compared to my earlier experiences. Not sure whether it has something to do with the kind of peanuts used for if it has vegetable oils, even though label claims 100% peanuts."
One of the best peanut butter.
"Very thin past like water 😡, quality of the product compromising by company ,,, it geGives negative feed back,,,"
pintola peanut butter is really good in spite of being unsweetened it tastes really good and ofcourse it is healthy.
"This is my first jar of Pintola's peanut butter before this i ordered Alpino's , in comparison to Alpino , this one is more liquidy and i like Alpino's texture better. Alpino has more peanuty taste , maybe it's the type of different peanuts both companies are using. But for me Alpino is the better product.Edit: it's a good peanut butter, and because its july and extremely hot here that's why it seems liquidy. Go for it. Its good 🤘"
Good
I expected this to be a bit solid form like almond butter but it's fine. It tastes superb and is good for weight loss and gym people. I would suggest this those people who don't like sugar and it's crunchy af I can't think how crunchy will the extra one will be!
Good for health. Very tasty
Veri good in taste
Overall spread is tasty and the best part is it is unsweetened but if it could be little bit less costly i would have given it 5 stars.
""
Good Product
Tests best with Apple
The Pintola peanut butter is one of the best Peanut Butter I ever tested. The quality is awesome as always.
Value for money
Tasty Yummy 😋
Best
"I generally take it with brown bread and banana, yes, peanut butter sandwich . tastes really great with atta rotis also. I've bought this product for the 4th time from amazon. no issues, Go and buy.!!!"
"So the brand & all is goodTaste is niceBut after you use and cannot consume in a single season, I just noticed a layer of buttery liquid above the remaining butter.. and it wasn’t expired!"
"It's not as sugary as some of the other products available in the market.Tastes good and can be used by everyone in your family. Also, this is good for health.Stay away from sugary products, you will lose a lot of bad fat, eventually."
Nice
"off-course this butter look weird on top with lake of oil suspension, to not speak further they already put the disclaimer mentioning oil separation is the natural process, hence i don't mind. as you consume on and on. you find the hard crust at the bottom with no oil (i am sure none will mind).i use it with chapati and oats meal preparation.so finally i do recommend this product to everyone. but just don't consume like nutella.once i had used ASITIS product, they had salted it so i terminated it.finally settled to it."
I haven't used any other brand peanut butter. I regularly purchased 1 kg Pintola Peanut butter which I felt was really good. Got a deal for 2.5 kg and hence purchased it. The consistency in 1 kg was much better than in 2.5 kg.  The consistency of the spread was less in the top 1 inch of the container and it was very fluidic to use it as a spread.Will go with 1 kg going forward.
"Earlier I used to buy Sundrop peanut butter and this is the first time I thought to try Pintola. Here's the quick difference between both.Sundrop:1. Costs Rs 285/kg, tasty, easy to spread, creamy appearance.2. Protein (26.8%), Sugar (10%), Fat (52%) per 100 gm.Pintola:1. Costs Rs 375/kg, tasteless, not easy to spread at all, liquid in appearance.2. Protien (30%), Sugar (3%), Fat (49%) per 100 gm."
Good product
Most tastiest peanut butter i have ever tried
"The package arrived with the seal half removed, & a bit of the butter was in the box, nothing very bad, but not a good impression. The butter tastes good, it's unsweetened, & has literally no sugar at all. If you've had sweetened peanut butter before & try this, it's going leave a bad taste, cause, no sugar, but.. it is what the advertisement says, completely unsweetened, & fresh, which it is!!"
Quality goodBut flavour average
Ek no product hei. 100% national. Maza aa gaya khake.
"So far i have ordered 2 of them and i got good quality and same taste as mentioned on the jar. Very important is that it doesn't have Hydrogenated oil, which is bad for the health. Always buy Peanut butter which doesn't contain Hydrogenated oil,  that is very important if you are health conscious."
"Love this one. Need to stir the product well before use or else as you keep using, the bottom part is too hard. Better to stir it once a while to get an even spread. Good quality product at affordable price. Love it!"
"On receiving, the product came with decent packaging. After opening it, I saw it was watery but after a good strong stirring you can get paste like consistency. The taste was good. Not great but average. Another thing that put me off was the label that was not at all the kind I've come to expect. It was cheap printed label stuck on a jar. Overall, it's an OK product but my next buy will be Alpino which was quite impressive when I bought it last time."
You would not like the taste as it is not sweet but it's really the original peanut butter taste
"It stays liquid and doesn't get hard when kept in refrigerator, it's very easy to spread as it's ij liquid form. Real taste since it's unsweetened. Product is really good."
Good flavor 👒
"Purchased 1st time consumed half bottle till now and it is good, no issue will the quality…👍👍"
If any of you guys looking for taste it's not for youSugarless and it's freshnessMakes it decent oneI liked it
Good Product
Liked it
"Perfect and natural, no added sugar and presevatives.... Go for it"
"It's a good product. With so many varieties of peanut butters in the market, I've been using pintola peanut butter from last 5 years."
"I have been using this product since last 6 months. I have tried both crunchy and creamy. Absolutely no complaints regarding quality of this product. 100 percent natural, no added substance. If you are looking for tasty as well as healthy option this should be your choice.Packaging of this product is also satisfying. Now that I have tried it once I don’t think I will ever choose any other brand in future.Go for it guys, you won’t regret it."
Okay product
Very good
"It's little bit thicker than others but yeah I liked it. It's unflavored so, if anyone who's expecting a sweet flavor might get disheartened but overall it's a good buy. Please don't trade your quality with price. Maintain a balance and keep getting the respect your brand deserves because people really need good products.Maintain the quality or make it better."
"It's a good spread even though it's texture is crunchy. Nutrition conscious people can buy this, but I would say just buy the ones with taste. I am a fitness guy who does bodybuilding on the side, I would say end of the day the flavor in regular P  gets you to eat more peanut butter and that's what matters, you can adjust the micro nutrients on other meals."
It need more cruncy
"I had not realized that it had nothing added, which imho is not a bad thing at all - better this than than consuming synthetic additives. We added a little honey and salt for seasoning which definitely balanced the flavours (atleast for my palate). Peanuts are a tad bit over-roasted - this has been observed by another reviewer as well.The jar was completely covered in oil - though the bottle itself was intact and sealed (which brings down my rating more than anything else). Amazon box was too big for the bottle due to which it was knocking around and definitely susceptible to damage. Mfgs definitely need to invest in an outer box of some sort!"
Nice product for fitness lover
"PRODUCT IS GOOD,BUT PACKAGING OF PRODUCT IS WROST. THE JAR IS LEAKED FROM THE TOP AND BUTTER IS OUT FROM THE JAR,VERY DISAPPOINTED FROM AMOZON PACKING"
Satisfying experience
I mean this was my first product and this was really good I don't need to find any other brand now.. i bought choco flavor this time but its not that good so go with the original one..my words..
Good
"Very gooey - drips all over the place. Taste is bland. I've had unsweetened before, but this just doesn't taste that good. Maybe can be used as an ingredient in something else, but not really good if you're having it directly..."
The product is very goodफ्लावर  is good
"Thickness of peanut butter is drastically reduced.... previously there was nut oil floating and the product was much more thicker and pure,moreover they are providing 100 rs refund for good review"
GOOD ITTEM
I used to order pintola always but this time i have seen that there is adulteration in the butter. Formerly it used to be very smooth and cream but this time when i opened the box there was strange hard oily layer which was like a bad oil was there. And whenever i use it now on my bread as a spread its like good when cold but slowly it melts like a oil.
Cap was broken... Product should be handled with more caution
Go for sweeter or flavored product. Personally i don't liked the unsweetened one.
"I have minor allergy to peanuts . But for some reason , this peanut butter is causing more problems even in small quantities.If you are looking for just proteins , but you have any nut allergy , i won't recommend to buy it . Infact don't buy any peanut butter for that case."
"The Pintola peanut butter is very watery! It lacks the consistency and thickness of a peanut butter.The ingredients on pack say it only contains roasted peanuts, but I guess it contains either added water or added oil or a liquid of some sort.This creates a mess if you have to use it as a spread on bread. It may work if you are looking to blend it with milk or water drinks.I have been using peanut butters from different brand, have used them during my stay in the US as well. ALL peanut butters have thick consistency.Taste: taste is plain bland. Which can be a good thing if you want to add your own flavour or mix it with something else. Like, I take my bread with peanut butter and add a layer of jam to add taste. Sadly, can't use Pintola PB on a bread due to watery consistency.Rest all looks good. Will update the review after a week of consumption.Have a good health!"
"Need to be consistent, recently bought pack is very liquidy , difficult to spread it drips."
Good
"The nutritional information says 30 grams protein per 100 grams of peanut butter, but right next to it the label says 16 grams protein per 32grams serving of peanut butter. That make no sense mathematically and it astounds me that no one in this company saw this problem."

Avg product
please sell newer stock. finishing 1 kg within 2 months is not always possible. this is why i always have to go for 350g pack. maybe I'll just buy the 1kg pack from local store now
I know it's healthy. It spreads well on toast bread. It's crunchy.But somehow I didn't like the feeling. Mouth becomes dry and it sticks on to your enamel. Need some tea or coffee to gulp it down. I would rather eat peanuts just like that.
It stuck in our mouth too much and flavour is average not good not bad.Thankyou
This time when I ordered and received the package I feel some difference from the previous one which is same flavor. It feels like they have added water in it and doesn't match the taste as I had before. I am not sure what was the reason for this and this needs to be investigated.
The taste is good not so oily and pure organic no sugar so nice
"I would not say it's the best peanut butter I have tried, but it's might be a good choice at this price range.When I opened the lid it was liquid , few days later it started becoming thick.It's easy to spread. No issue with digestion.Overall okay okay product."
I don't like it's Taste
"I bought this large bottle. The butter experiences oil separation after some time (which is natural) and the butter left post the separation is very dry. I would recommend buying smaller bottles instead for convenience. Also, better to buy the smooth one than crunchy."
One top of the jar there's literally half an inch layer of oil floating. And the overall content in the jar is almost liquid. I've tried different brands from india as well as foreign countries and i definitely wouldn't call this peanut butter.
"This is the first time for me to try the so called natural peanut butter. To be honest, not to my taste. In room temperature, there are lots of oil on top of the jar. Only after refrig it for a few days, it turns mostly solid. There are also quite a bit of large chunks inside, making it hard to spread. What I like most about peanut butter is the great fragrance when spreading it on hot toasts, with this brand, the peanut butter does not really melt and does not give me much fragrance either.I regret purchasing it, especially such a big package. Will try to find ways to consume it."
Correct the PER SERVE Nutrition values- All of them are wrong . It's to much misleading.
"After a ton of research and reading reviews on Amazon I ordered my first unsweetened Pintola Peanut Butter,And I am truly disappointed.The problem is not with the taste but with the texture, it’s very gluey and sticky and let me tell you it’s not a pleasant experience to chew sticky food in your mouth!Also every time there is an accumulation of oil on the surface, blending it back with the peanut butter becomes a struggle due to the sticky nature and of this peanut butter.This peanut butter is certainly overrated.The taste however does feel like that of legit peanuts.But the joy of eating it is ruined by the unfortunate texture.I unquestionably am not going to order this again.Hope you all find this helpful!"
"This was my first experience to try anything other than Skippy peanut butter. The flavor was not bad but it lacked the roughness and flavor.It is more fluid, oily and does have peanut flavor. It might appeal to someone trying peanut butter for the  first time."
"There is some ingredient that is not mentioned on the product and it seems fishy. As I have also prepared peanut butter on my own and the paste is thrice as thick as this one. I even have to add 2 table spoons of ghee to the paste, in order to liquify it to make a good consistent paste, even then the paste was twice as thick than this one.I'll request Pintola to kindly share the true list of ingredients used."
After reaching peanut butter to me it was fully watery I kept it in fridge after that I found it's still watery then if we will dip spoon you will find all bulkier material is in middle of bottle & it won't spread on bread so easily & believe me it's very difficult to eat with bread or alone because it will stick to all your mouth it took 5 min for me to eat bread with that now the only way to finish it is with milk or anyother liquid & it's without any flavor it's just plain peanut butter may be the genuine one but I personally not happy with it if your a plain peanut butter lover then it might be good for you
"Have been using this particular peanut butter for a few years now and have really liked it until now. Don't know what's going on with the manufacturing process but the consistency of this BUTTER has really degraded. It's literally a Peanut syrup now with added peanut granules.I really hoped that a few hours of refrigeration would take care of the consistency like yesteryears but alas it didn't turn out that way.Quite cumbersome to handle as you'll have to make sure there's no spillage while opening the container.Only positive aspect is there hasn't been a deterioration in the taste of the butter."
"It has the great mixibility and great quality of peanut butter.But it is just too runny,tasteless,oily texture"
I am regularly buying this product. I find nowadays that the butter is very liquid. Previously it used to be thicker and would last for more time. Nowadays it is not so.
"The product is as such good but there is a small drawback. The butter contains small pieces of solid peanuts, unlike other better know brands which have a smooth butter-like texture that is not there with this brand."
I tried after my friend recommended it as bestest peanut butter. I did not like much. The paste is less thick and it's drip off. The taste is just ok type.
Not that much good
"I am here after completing 1 kg pintola peanut butter. It was not that easy to spread, On taste I didn't like it first but then it was good and also flavor was unsweetened so u can understand. In initial days after eating this butter I was not able to chew it with ease cause it was so sticky I have to drink water with it to chew."
"I am a regular buyer of this product ,I like this peanut butter every which way. But today i got damaged product. When i unpacked it and hold the container, some kind of oil was all spread over it & was leaking from the top.I opened it. There was a big hole in the seal. Probably it got damaged in transportation. Poor packaging. Its truly Disappointing!!"
Too much sugar
What I like about this product is the crunchiness. What I don't like is that it's very liquidy. Consistency could have been a bit thicker.
Natural product
I have found that  not up to mark bcz too much oil separation.
Best in calss as compared to available products online.
It was thick and it was like an actual peanut butter when i used it last time but now it is more watery and thin. I guess pintola has started putting more water in it.
"I used it once and left it for a week. The next time I opened the bottle, my peanut granules had settled at the bottom and oil was afloat at the top. So I drained the excess oil- I was on a diet and hence had bought unsweetened butter.The next time I opened it after a week , more oil was there. So I drained it again.Just oil. Transparent layer of oil. 0.5 cm thick layer.This kept on going. Until all the granules had settled. Also, even when you try mixing the oil to the peanut part of it, it doesnt. For some wierd reasons."
Pintola peanut butter is too watery for me. It runs down so easily. As a result of this it has less of chunkness of peanuts. So it is ok for people who loves theirs a little watery or runny. Else avoit it
It's totally in liquid form. Looks like they have mixed a lot of water in the peanut butter. Taste is ok
Flavor is kind of ok but when you compare it with sundrop peanut butter you will find Sundrop more tasty and crunchy.Both are good in freshness.What I don't like in Pintola is if you will keep it in fridge it will not freeze. And it will not freeze then there will be more liquid kind of thing floating above to pasty peanut butter which is I don't like personally.One more thing.... There is a lot difference between its price.This is my experience after used it.
Nice
"More peanut oil that butter. Everything else is good. But at the end you are consuming more calories without protein. You can literally pour this Peanut butter. Yes, there us no taste of sugar but inorder to compensate that they have added a lot of oil."
Like it average
"First time I have seen a spred in a semi liquid form,It comes without added sugar in it, that is good,But the product is not that satisfying. Liquid spred with just a lot of crushed penuts.Added on 19/10/20It was liquid on top but not at the bottom last, it means the spread is not mixed properly , very dry at the bottom ,Over all good"
"The taste of the product was good but it was too runny to be used as butter spread. The consistency is more of like a peanut soup than butter.Other than that, the taste is good and unaltered by artificial preservatives and sweetners."
Good products
Not a good taste
Good
"I seen this in KETO diet and brought but i am unable to eat more as its plain taste not allowing me to eat more of it..... i had to sprinkle some sugar over it and adjusted.The quality is good, packaging and price is reasonable.You can try if you like to reduce a few pound as adding sugar will not give good result in case u do diet.Thanks for reading."
All good about the peanut butter but the seal cover really sucks.
Too much oily
i have had many peanut butter before but this peanut butter gave me allergy. i don't like the way oil settles on the top separately but its quite normal as written in its description. its good for people who want a sugarfree peanut butter. not good in taste as well.
"Go for the 1kg one ...better packing ,This one packing is horrible and tastes varries"
"Packaging is too good and delivered before time . Freshness ,taste ,easy to spread everything thing is perfect . I think you Should try it ...."
This is very liwuid nd also tasteless but peanut quality is good
Taste not good but ok
"Product is ok, no sweetnesses, good for diabetic people, didn’t like by children. Taste is not good, will get nice taisty product in market"
"Everytime I ordered this product, the taste is different.This time it seems like some peanuts were burnt.Initially the product quality was good.. Now deteriorating."
Its very nice except that its too viscous or gooey. Its difficult to swallow as it doesn't mix with water or saliva while gulping.
No added sugar still tasty and easy to spread butter. Have tried many other brands but this is one of the better ones
I had different idea of how peanut butter would taste. But it's like eating a liquid peanut. Quality wise it's good and taste wise I would not prefer.
"I have been using product from a long time. I love it!However this time the packaging was really loose, butter was already spilled over the delivery box and the container. Cap was not tighten at all."
Thank you seller you provide such a wonderful 👍😊😊 products
"Okay product maybe good as in it doest have added sugar but after using a larger quantity pack felt at last when it was 25% left, it became thick solid in texture Harder substance and stuck to bottom. It became like bornvita or Horlicks when comes in contact with moisture becomes harder inside jar, just like that."
"Composition and taste is good, but it is extremely thin. It's very difficult to apply on bread using a butter knife."
Good
"Decent spread though not consistent, it's not gooy and the consistency is also not thick enough, loved the taste though, but if u are expecting it to be thick you will be disappointed."
I have been consuming Pintola peanut butter for about 3 years now. I don't know if any of the recent customers have noticed this but back in the days it used to be thick butter but now the water contains has increased. That's why the old customers has started to moving to another brands.
When i started consuming it after two to three days i facing constipation problem.I think It has no fiber.
Butter is good but at the bottom of container butter is turning hard... Which makes it impossible to spread and it still remain hard in the peanut butter shakes. Ugh the delivery was pathetic my container lid was broken and butter got leaked.
"It's overrated, if you're rich or don't value the money then just go buy it, there's so much water in it that makes it like a liquid cream, it's so expensive if you see the ingredients are water and roasted peanuts only"
I ordered 2 peanut butter packs and in which one is seal packed and other is not . So be aware while buying
I will never eat peanut butter again.May be it actually tastes that way.Product was good by the way
In this mixer I think butter is missing
There isn't enough peanut buttery flavour compared to many other brands available. It seems like either the quality of peanuts used is not great or it hasn't been toasted enough to bring the flavour out. I'm comparing it only with other 100% brands and not the ones with added flavouring.
"The consistency is liquid,Taste is ok , unsweetenedpacking is good.better go for other brand if you need some solid form."
"The Peanut Butter is Tasty and nice. My only problem is with the Packaging, as the Box i received had a cracked and broken lid and the seal as well was slightly open. I will be buying another one as the current one is almost over and hopefully, this time i receive a proper package with no breakage."
Peanut butter spread like water. I always purchase pintola since long time but not again
It is easy to spread and It is very tasty.
It's gluten free 😂Healthy but not tasty
Not looking like natural
Oil in butter
"Nice quality peanut butter. But butter is less & peanuts are super big, crunchy, that makes spreading little hard. I wish little more butter than peanut pieces in it."
It is good.  But it is sticking in mouth little. I used this first time
"This is the product which i received, This might be done furing transportation but, it means your packaging is of very low quality that it broke during transportation.Worst buying experince on amazaon with this one till now."
Test is not good according to myself
The cap is loose and faulty.
"The quality good, but it is sticking to our tongue, teeth and chicks inside the mouth... It is so hard to eat"
"Due to extra cruchiness it has lots of peanut chunks which doesnt feel good in mouth.Taste wise its okay, wat more can u expect in a product which has no added sweetner.I thinks u can go for it if u like chunky peanut"
"Too much oil this time"
I like it because it is not sweet but its just too runny...
Product is overall good but after 5 to 6 month product losses it's freshness and started to become solid it was hard to spread and eat
How is peanut butter so watery if it’s all natural? 30% of it is all water

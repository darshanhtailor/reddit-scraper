"So the brand & all is goodTaste is niceBut after you use and cannot consume in a single season, I just noticed a layer of buttery liquid above the remaining butter.. and it wasnâ€™t expired!",Refrigerate for long lasting freshness.
"off-course this butter look weird on top with lake of oil suspension, to not speak further they already put the disclaimer mentioning oil separation is the natural process, hence i don't mind. as you consume on and on. you find the hard crust at the bottom with no oil (i am sure none will mind).i use it with chapati and oats meal preparation.so finally i do recommend this product to everyone. but just don't consume like nutella.once i had used ASITIS product, they had salted it so i terminated it.finally settled to it.",It is the natural oil present in peanut. There is no extra oil added. Place the container upside down for sometime for the oil to mix.
"I had not realized that it had nothing added, which imho is not a bad thing at all - better this than than consuming synthetic additives. We added a little honey and salt for seasoning which definitely balanced the flavours (atleast for my palate). Peanuts are a tad bit over-roasted - this has been observed by another reviewer as well.The jar was completely covered in oil - though the bottle itself was intact and sealed (which brings down my rating more than anything else). Amazon box was too big for the bottle due to which it was knocking around and definitely susceptible to damage. Mfgs definitely need to invest in an outer box of some sort!",It is the natural oil present in peanut. There is no extra oil added. Place the container upside down for sometime for the oil to mix.
"PRODUCT IS GOOD,BUT PACKAGING OF PRODUCT IS WROST. THE JAR IS LEAKED FROM THE TOP AND BUTTER IS OUT FROM THE JAR,VERY DISAPPOINTED FROM AMOZON PACKING",Send images with proof to customer support for further assistance.
I used to order pintola always but this time i have seen that there is adulteration in the butter. Formerly it used to be very smooth and cream but this time when i opened the box there was strange hard oily layer which was like a bad oil was there. And whenever i use it now on my bread as a spread its like good when cold but slowly it melts like a oil.,It is the natural oil present in peanut. There is no extra oil added.

"Need to be consistent, recently bought pack is very liquidy , difficult to spread it drips.",Mix well with a spoon.
One top of the jar there's literally half an inch layer of oil floating. And the overall content in the jar is almost liquid. I've tried different brands from india as well as foreign countries and i definitely wouldn't call this peanut butter.,It is the natural oil present in peanut. There is no extra oil added.

"This was my first experience to try anything other than Skippy peanut butter. The flavor was not bad but it lacked the roughness and flavor.It is more fluid, oily and does have peanut flavor. It might appeal to someone trying peanut butter for the  first time.",It is the natural oil present in peanut. There is no extra oil added.

"I am a regular buyer of this product ,I like this peanut butter every which way. But today i got damaged product. When i unpacked it and hold the container, some kind of oil was all spread over it & was leaking from the top.I opened it. There was a big hole in the seal. Probably it got damaged in transportation. Poor packaging. Its truly Disappointing!!",It is the natural oil present in peanut. There is no extra oil added. Place the container upside down for sometime for the oil to mix.
What I like about this product is the crunchiness. What I don't like is that it's very liquidy. Consistency could have been a bit thicker.,Mix well with a spoon.
"I used it once and left it for a week. The next time I opened the bottle, my peanut granules had settled at the bottom and oil was afloat at the top. So I drained the excess oil- I was on a diet and hence had bought unsweetened butter.The next time I opened it after a week , more oil was there. So I drained it again.Just oil. Transparent layer of oil. 0.5 cm thick layer.This kept on going. Until all the granules had settled. Also, even when you try mixing the oil to the peanut part of it, it doesnt. For some wierd reasons.",It is the natural oil present in peanut. There is no extra oil added. Place the container upside down for sometime for the oil to mix.
Butter is good but at the bottom of container butter is turning hard... Which makes it impossible to spread and it still remain hard in the peanut butter shakes. Ugh the delivery was pathetic my container lid was broken and butter got leaked.,Send images with proof to customer support for further assistance.

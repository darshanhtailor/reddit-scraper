Something is wrong with the Nutrition facts. It says it has 16g protein in one serve of 32g but in 100g it has 30g of protein. A simple quick math can tell you what is wrong with this. 16*3=48g protein for 3 serves that is 96g (<100). I can't say which column of nutrition facts is true. Hopefully they fix this.,wrong nutrition fact say g protein serve g g g protein simple quick math tell wrong 3=48 g protein serve g < column nutrition fact true hopefully fix,-0.06333333333333335,Negative

"I had not realized that it had nothing added, which imho is not a bad thing at all - better this than than consuming synthetic additives. We added a little honey and salt for seasoning which definitely balanced the flavours (atleast for my palate). Peanuts are a tad bit over-roasted - this has been observed by another reviewer as well.The jar was completely covered in oil - though the bottle itself was intact and sealed (which brings down my rating more than anything else). Amazon box was too big for the bottle due to which it was knocking around and definitely susceptible to damage. Mfgs definitely need to invest in an outer box of some sort!",realize add imho bad thing well consume synthetic additive add little honey salt season definitely balance flavour atleast palate peanut tad bit roasted observe reviewer well.the jar completely cover oil bottle intact seal bring rating amazon box big bottle knock definitely susceptible damage mfg definitely need invest outer box sort,-0.11249999999999998,Negative
